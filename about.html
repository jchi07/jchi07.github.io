<!-- introduction -->
  <p>Hello! My name is Can and I'm the creator of this website. During the Summer Self-Paced Immersion Program at Girls Who Code, I deicided to create this website to spread awareness of gender equality and help to close the gender pay gap in the workplace. I think it's important for the society to provide equal opportunities for girls and women.</p>
